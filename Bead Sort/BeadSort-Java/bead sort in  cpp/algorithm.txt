    1. Initialize a ' transposed_list' to contain as many elements as
    2. the maximum value of the input -- in effect, taking the 'tallest'
    3. column of input beads and laying it out flat
        transposed_list = [0] * max(input_list)
    4.for num in input_list:
        1. For each element (each 'column of beads') of the input list,
        2.'lay the beads flat' by incrementing as many elements of the
        3. transposed list as the column is tall.
        4. These will accumulate atop previous additions.

    5. We've now dropped the beads. To de-transpose, we count the
    6. 'bottommost row' of dropped beads, then mimic removing this
    7. row by subtracting 1 from each 'column' of the transposed list.
    8. When a column does not reach high enough for the current row,
    9.its value in transposed_list will be <= 0.
    10.for _ in input_list:
        1. Counting values > 0 is how we tell how many beads are in the
        2. current 'bottommost row'. Note that Python's bools can be
        3. evaluated as integers; True == 1 and False == 0.
            return_list.append(sum(n > 0 for n in transposed_list))
        4. Remove the 'bottommost row' by subtracting 1 from each element.
        transposed_list = [n - 1 for n in transposed_list]
    11. The resulting list is sorted in descending order
    12. return return_list
