This is not a new sorting algorithm, but an idea when we need to avoid swapping of large objects or need to access elements of a large array in both original and sorted orders.
A common sorting task is to sort elements of an array using a sorting algorithm like Quick Sort, Bubble Sort.. etc, but there may be times when we need to keep the actual array in tact and use a “tagged” array to store the correct positioning of the array when it is sorted. When we want to access elements in sorted way, we can use this “tagged” array.

Why to use Tag Sort?

When we are operating on large array of objects, it might be too costly to swap these large object. After all its about the disk swaps and we want to minimize it!

Tag Sort allows sorting an integer array after tagging it with original object.
In turn, we only swap the tag array integers instead of large array of objects.
The actual elements are not being changed during the sort process. The positions in the tag array are being changed so they will hold the correct ordering of the elements when they are sorted.
