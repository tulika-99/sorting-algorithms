The algorithm for odd even sort in c++ is as follows:-
example: the array is {34, 2, 10, -9}
First, we consider array to be unsorted,
Then, we run a while loop which begins with considering array as sorted. It runs until array is not sorted. We intialize a 
for loop for the elements at odd indices. If arr[i]>arr[i+1], we swap them.  With each swap we set isSorted value to false.
A second for loop is initialized for elemnts at even indices.  If arr[i]>arr[i+1], we swap them. With each swap we set isSorted 
value to false.
This repeated swapping finally sorts the array,
